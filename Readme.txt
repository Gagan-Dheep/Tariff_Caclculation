# Tariff_Caclculation

1. Abstract
The Electricity Tariff Calculator is a command-line utility designed to compute electricity 
tariffs for consumers based on their consumer type (domestic or industrial) and the time of 
day they utilize electricity. This report provides an in-depth overview of the project, including 
its purpose, scope, key features, and its potential impact on consumers and utility companies.

2. Introduction
2.1 Background
Electricity is a fundamental utility that powers our modern world. Different consumers, such 
as residential (domestic) and industrial, have varying requirements and usage patterns. 
Additionally, many utility companies implement time-dependent charges to encourage offpeak usage and optimize resource allocation. However, calculating these tariffs manually can 
be complex and error-prone.
The Electricity Tariff Calculator addresses this challenge by automating the tariff calculation 
process. It is a valuable tool for consumers to estimate their electricity costs accurately and 
for utility companies to ensure fair billing practices.
2.2 Objectives
The primary objectives of the Electricity Tariff Calculator are as follows:
- Develop a user-friendly program for calculating electricity tariffs.
- Differentiate tariffs between domestic and industrial consumers.
- Apply time-dependent charges based on usage hours.
- Facilitate easy data input and transparent tariff display.
